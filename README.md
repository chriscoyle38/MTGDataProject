# MTGDataProject


Motivation:

This project is to explore and examine Magic the Gathering card pricing data available from MTGJson to find attributes of cards that make them hold their value and make them good for resale. I also examined if "chase" cards are better for reselling vs other Magic cards by comparing how well they hold their value(% change over 90 days) and their potential profit(market price - buylist price - fees).

Code Style:

Jupyter Notebook

Features:

Put MTGJson pricing and card data into a useable datafrmae to be able to examine card pricing data and find what cards are the best to buy at buylist prices and resell at market prices.
